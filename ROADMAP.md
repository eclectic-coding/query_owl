# ROADMAP

## 0.5.0 — Developer Experience

- `query_owl:clear` Rake task — drain the in-memory `EventStore` from the console or a deploy script

---

## 0.6.0 — Test Support

- `QueryOwl::TestHelper` — opt-in module providing RSpec matchers and Minitest assertions (e.g. `expect { }.not_to trigger_n_plus_one`) for use in integration test suites

---

## 1.0.0 — Stable Public API

- Locked public configuration interface with deprecation warnings for removed options
- Full README: usage guide, configuration reference, mount instructions, upgrade notes, links to ROADMAP and CONTRIBUTING
